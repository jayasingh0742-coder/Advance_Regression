## General Information
- The project is basically about building regression Model to predict House Price
- Surpise Housing has decided to enter Australian Market and has collected dataset from the sales of houses in Australia. 
- You are required to model the price of houses with available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with variables. Further, the model will be a good way to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
- The dat has been collected from sale of houses in Australia and contains 1460 rows and 81 columns.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- From the Model, we conclude that prices houses which are located in better proximity / neighbourhood e.g Crawford , Somerst, NridgHt are mostly expensive to buy. Also if the overall Quality of the house is good with Normal Conditions will have more Selling Price.
- There isnt much difference in Ridge and Lasso Scores. Ridge seems to be performing slightly better than Lasso.
- However, given the number of  variables, we have chosen choose Lasso as it reduces the parameters.
